linux-kernel-extra
==================

This is a semi-official ABBS tree for extra Linux Kernel variants (patches,
forks, etc.) and configurations (say, for a specific machine type or processor
family). No binary is provided for packages in this tree, so you will need to
read our semi-comprehensive guide on how to build packages from an ABBS tree
[here](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-abbs/wiki).

Kernel variants

- Linux Kernel with machine specific optimizations
